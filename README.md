supposed to be a project to help me dig into the Exactly Once problem. https://exactly-once.github.io/posts/exactly-once-delivery/


I don't know where or when the project will end. I am also learning Go for the first time. So feel free to critique.

`go run .`

Goals:

Figure out how to emulate the 2 generals problem without actual networking - maybe emulate the network boundary??
Figure out how to fail often enough that I can easily test and play with things.
Figure out how to property based chaos engineering test this system
write tests :)
